# How to contribute

Thank you for being interested and using my plugin. :smiley_cat:

# Basic steps

1. Create a fork and checkout your fork.
2. Run `npm run preflight`.
3. [Create an issue](https://github.com/launcelot66/prettier-plugin-angular-class-decorators/issues/new) for your feature or fix.
4. Create a `Draft` pull request that also references your created issue.
5. Request me (@launcelot66) as reviewer.
6. When you are finished, press the `Ready for review`.

# Working on a pull request

- Please add tests for your implementation.
- Do not change the `CHANGELOG.md` or `version` in `package.json`, that will be my part after merging.
- Before switching from `Draft` to `Request for review`, please perform `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.
